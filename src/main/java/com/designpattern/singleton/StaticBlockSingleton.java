 *Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
 *Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
 *Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point for outer world to get the instance of the singleton class.
 *Static block initialization implementation is similar to eager initialization, except that instance of class is created in the static block that 
 *provides option for exception handling.
 *Both eager initialization and static block initialization creates the instance even before itâ€™s being used and that is not the best practice to use.
